# ShipRollMotionSimulation
Roll motion simulation of a container ship in regular and random waves using Bond-Graph Modelling in 20 Sim.


Roll motion analysis of a ship is critical for understading its crew habitability, stability and manoeuverability. The main objective of this project is to simulate the roll motion of a ship in various sea conditions.
